# Baltimore-school-performance-analysis
Abstract: 
  In this project, we examined the performance of Baltimore city schools on standardized testing the basis of demographic subgroups over time. We used data from the Baltimore City Schools website (baltimorecityschools.org) and the Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University (edopportunity.org). These datasets contained information on the mean standardized test scores for student subgroups (including race, gender, socioeconomic status, and more) from the academic years 2014-2018. We analyzed this data using a pivot table analysis to demonstrate how schools performed by subgroup over time. We also performed a cluster analysis [INSERT WHAT YOU DID HERE]. From the pivot table analysis, we found that the lowest-performing subgroups were male, black, and economically disadvantaged students. Mean standardized test performance has improved by approximately 1 point since 2014-15, recovering after a significant dip in the intermittent years. Although overall mean test performance has improved, the disparity between the mean score and the scores of low-performing subgroups has increased. These findings could point to unjust educational policies not allocating enough resources to help improve the educational quality of students from disadvantaged groups, or an institutionally biased method of standardized testing.

Data Analysis and Findings:

  The Industry Question: How can Baltimore city improve Educational policies in order to provide a higher quality education to disadvantaged groups? We decided on this question because in our initial search on civic issues and social inequality in Baltimore, we discovered that one of the biggest factors in social mobility was education. We came across an article from the Baltimore Sun, 'Baltimore City is failing its children', which cited poor city management as a potential cause of Baltimore City schools' abominable testing performance in comparison with nation-wide standards. Despite spending $15,564 per student, which is the fourth highest expenditure out of the 100 largest U.S. school districts, only 20% of Baltimore City schools met federally mandated progress goals for reading and math on the Maryland School Assessments. Baltimore has also performed poorly compared to other similar urban areas which have managed to improve overall testing performance over the last 8 years. This shows that the issue is not a lack of funds, but rather that too much money is being poured into ineffective programs. In order to improve the performance of Baltimore City schools, we chose to examine the lowest-performing groups and determine what demographic factors contributed to this disparity. We decided to approach this issue from the perspective of the Baltimore City government, and develop a question that would provide us with information that government officials could use to inform future decisions about educational spending and programs. By addressing this problem, we could improve the management of Baltimore City schools and the quality of education, resulting in more opportunities and higher social mobility for students from disadvantages backgrounds.
  
  The Data Question: In order to approach this question, we wanted to examine some metric of school performance by various demographic subgroups over time. We wanted to get a quantitative picture of how Baltimore city schools have performed over past years, which types of students perform well, and which types of students perform poorly. This data could reveal important information about which students educational programs should be targeting. While researching, we found a dataset from the Baltimore City school district website which contained data of average standardized test scores for racial, socioeconomic, gender, and other traits over five years. We chose to analyze this data using two methods: pivot table analysis and cluster analysis. 
  
  The Data Answer: [FINDINGS FROM CLUSTER ANALYSIS]
  We performed 4 different pivot charts to examine and visualize the performance of students across different demographic traits. The socioeconomic pivot analysis showed that although overall performance of schools has increased since 2014-15, the performance of economically disadvantaged students has decreased, resulting in a larger disparity between the two groups. The pivot analysis of racial groups showed that the 'other' racial subgroup has the highest scores across all years, followed by 'white', then 'hispanic', and lastly, 'black'. Again, this chart shows that the higher scoring 'other' and 'white' subgroups have improved over time, while 'hispanic' and 'black' scores have slightly decreased or remained the same, resulting in a larger disparity in 2018-19 than in 2014-15. The gender pivot analysis shows that females score significantly and cosnistently higher than males. The mean scores of females have improved, yet the mean scores of males remain roughly the same. These analyses show that although the overall picture of test scores may be on the right track, minority and disadvantaged groups are being left behind. The pivot analysis of test subject showed that in 2014-15, the mean scores on ELA tests were much higher than on math. Scores on both tests drastically dipped over the next three years to a similar level, then in 2018-19 recovered to the 2014-15 average, with math scores being slighly higher than ELA. Now that the two subjects are roughly equal, educational programs should focus on improving scores across the board, rather than one particular subject.
